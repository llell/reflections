can help me to find bugs
it also will save me a lot of time

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Its quite conveniently to choose when to commit manually, because computer doesn't know when u r are finishing some part of code,
and manually u can do it right when u need it!
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
I think that different control systems are handling multiple files in different ways because
the best solution for different problems are always different.
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Using this commands will help me to view how many
lines were changed
since my last update.
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Sure
Using of version control will make me more confident!
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I will definitely use git for version-control in my projects.
